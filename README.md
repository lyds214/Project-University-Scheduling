# dsc-csulb-front-end-development 

Welcome to the DSC CSULB Solution Challenge 2020-2021 repository for Front-end development! This is a <br> private repository 
containing the source code of the front-end for the application we will be building. 

## Steps for installation
> 1. Open Android Studio
> 2. Select File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Enter the github url: https://github.com/kevinjaypatel/dsc-csulb-front-end-development.git
> 3. Alternatively on VSC, clone the repository from GitHub then open the repository in VSC 

## Contributing
Those who are invited as collaborators can contribute as follows
> 1. In your local repository create a branch e.g. git branch \<your-first-last-name>-development -> git branch kevin-patel-development
> 2. Push your local repository to the github repository using the following command: git push origin \<name of your created branch> -> git push origin kevin-patel-development

<strong>Note</strong>: Creating branches between members will help us view the changes we make. Whenever we make <br> 
changes, work directly from your local branch before pushing changes to the main branch. The main branch of 
<br> the github repository will contain the main version of our software.
